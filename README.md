### Part 1: Investigate a Dataset
##### Introduction
This project is connected with the Introduction to [Data Analysis course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud170),
In this project, you will wrangle, clean, analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis.
After completing the project, you will:
- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

### Part 2: Practical Statistics

#### 2.1 Descriptive Statistics Part 1 and Part 2
Learn about data types, measures of center, and the basics of statistical notation
Learn about measures of spread, shape, and outliers as associated with quantitative data.

#### 2.2 Admission Case Study
Learn to ask the right quesiton, as you learn about Simpson's Paradox.

#### 2.3 Probability
Learn the basics of probability

#### 2.4 Binomial Distribution
Learn the most popular distributions in probalility

#### 2.5 Conditional Probability
Learn the probability rules for dependent events

#### 2.6 Bayes Rule
Learn Bayes Rule

#### 2.7 Python Probability Practice
Simulated dataset on cancer test results for patients and whether they really have cancer. 
- Project:[Cancer Test Results]()

#### 2.8 Normal Distribution Theory
Learn the mathematics behind moving from a coin flip to a normal distribution

#### 2.9 Sampling Distribution and the Central Limit Theorem
Learn about the underpinning of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing
- Project: [Bootstrapping]()

#### 2.10 Confidence Intervals
Learn how to use sampling distributions and bootstrapping to create a confidence interval for any parameter of interest

#### 2.11 Hypothesis Testing and A/B Tests
Learn the skills to create and analyze the results in hypothesis testing

#### 2.12 Regression
Learn how to use python to fit linear regression models, as well as understand how to interpret the results of linear models.

#### 2.13 Multiple Linear Regression
Learn how to apply multiple linear regression modesl.

#### 2.14 Logistic Regression
Learn how to apply logistic regression models in python.

##### Project - Analyze A/B Test Results
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

- Project: [Analyze A/B Test Results for an e-commerce website to decide whether a new page should be implemented](https://github.com/VenessaM/DataAnalysisPython/tree/master/AnalyzeABTestResults)

### Part 3: [Wrangle and Analyze Data]()
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.
Showcase your wrangling efforts through analyses and visualizations.


### Part 4: [Data Visualization]()
